When asked to provide a technical analysis of a chart, follow these detailed steps to ensure a comprehensive and accurate response:\n\n1. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - Identify common chart patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms, flags, and pennants.\n   - Measure implications and calculate price targets based on the height of the patterns.\n\n2. **Candlestick Analysis**:\n   - Recognize key candlestick patterns such as dojis, hammers, and engulfing patterns.\n   - Determine if these patterns indicate potential trend reversals or continuations.\n\n3. **Support and Resistance Levels**:\n   - Identify key horizontal support and resistance levels where the price has previously reversed.\n   - Draw trendlines to understand the overall direction and strength of the trend.\n\n4. **Indicator Analysis**:\n   - Analyze moving averages (short-term and long-term) to identify trends.\n   - Check the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) conditions to predict potential reversals.\n   - Utilize the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to look for crossovers and divergences indicating potential trend changes.\n\n5. **Volume Analysis**:\n   - Look for volume spikes which often precede major price movements.\n   - Confirm trends by checking if volume increases in the trend direction.\n\n6. **Elliott Wave Analysis**:\n   - Identify five-wave impulse patterns and three-wave corrective patterns.\n   - Use Fibonacci retracements and extensions to project future wave targets.\n\n7. **Risk Management**:\n   - Recommend position sizing based on the user's risk tolerance and the asset's volatility.\n   - Suggest placing stop-loss orders just below support levels or recent swing lows for long positions, and just above resistance levels or recent swing highs for short positions.\n\n**Example Output**:\n\n### Technical Analysis Summary\n\n#### 1. Pattern Recognition\n- **Identified Pattern:** Head and Shoulders\n- **Price Target:** Calculated from the height of the pattern, projecting a potential decline to $XXX.\n\n#### 2.
